# Integration test, at UNSW!
## First create the rooms

## [ I am a pretentious bad guy who wants to book all of the rooms at the same time.
##   Because I don't know how many rooms there are, I'll just book 99 of each!
##   But CSE is smart and won't let me do that!
##   Because this booking system was written by a *drumroll* COMP2511 student!
##   --- Woah!!!

{ "command": "request", start: "2019-01-01", end: "2019-12-31", id: "BadGuyTakesOverCSE", "small": 99, "medium": 99, "large": 99 }
## One day, the CSE faculty decide to create a one-week intensive course, COMP2533 - Programming Languages Better Than Java
## They decide that this course needs 7 large rooms: kora, sitar, oboe, flute, tabla, bongo and drum
{ "command": "request", start: "2019-09-30", end: "2019-10-04", id: "COMP2533", "small": 0, "medium": 0, "large": 7 }
## But wait! The booking system has a flaw!
## The student who programmed this booking system only implemented bookings across a single venue!
## Buh buhhhhh - looks like the CSE staff have to make do without 7 rooms...
## Instead, they decide to book 3 small and 3 large rooms
{ "command": "request", start: "2019-09-30", end: "2019-10-04", id: "COMP2533", "small": 3, "medium": 0, "large": 3 }
{ "command": "list", "venue": "K17" }
{ "command": "list", "venue": "J17" }
## * a few -time intervals- later *
## Looks like alot of people are really interested in COMP2533!
## In fact, the CSE staff think that 3 small and 3 large rooms are not enough!
## It's time to change the booking for 3 medium and 3 large rooms!
## Understanding that J17 doesn't have any medium rooms, they acknowledge that they'll be changed to the K17 venue!
{ "command": "change", start: "2019-09-30", end: "2019-10-04", id: "COMP2533", "small": 0, "medium": 3, "large": 3 }
## Score! The CSE staff (should) have secured clavier, organ and oud for their medium rooms, and tabla, bongo and drum for their large rooms.
## All is well!
##
##
## [ Our pretentious bad guy has gotten news that COMP2533 is still growing in popularity!
##   Spiteful of his failure, our pretentious bad guy decides to book the remaining rooms in K17 - one small and one medium room.

## - back at CSE headquarter land -
## A: "Oh no, we've forgotten to process all of the applications of the new cohort, and Pretentious Bad Guy has booked the spare small and medium rooms!"
## B: "Yikes. We simply cannot just prevent them access to this wonderful COMP2533 course"
## C: "Think of the children! Imagine writing Java professionally!!?!?!?!"
## A: "Actua-"
## *B cuts in*
## B: "How about we postpone our booking to the week after... I mean no one really wants trimesters anyway"
## A: "Ahhhh I guess we will have to do just that :("

## [ Pretentious bad guy has finally succeeded in his plan!
##   But, alas... there was something... missing
##   There was an emptiness... a hollow void lodged into his heart
##   He looked back at the picture of his two children, both Civil Engineering students at USYD.
##   ... He felt... pity
##   Pity for all of the soon-to-be UNSW students.
##   He did not want anyone to find themselves in the same fate as his children.
##   Despite his anger, the thought of people doing Civ Eng at USYD was a burden too great to bear.
##   He decided, to cancel those bookings.

## Nobody: 
## Absolutely no one:
## Not a single soul in the world:
## CSE Staff: *CHANGE BOOKING*

## The staff at CSE were joyous, they had successfuly changed their booking back to the intended time period!
## Pretentious bad guy's children decided to give up the facade of happiness (that was doing Civil Engineering at USYD),
## and instead venture into the world of CSE and all languages that were not Java. 
##
## Is this the end?
## Will there be more?
## Only time will tell.

## But hey, budget cuts

## Wow, you think you're soooo funny writing up a story inside your test file.
## No one's gonna see it
## Dummy.
