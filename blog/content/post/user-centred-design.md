## TL;DR

We write software to be USED by people, not for machines to use.  
Therefore we need to write software in a way that is intuitive and makes sense to humans!

## Usability Heuristics

* Visibility of system status - Can easily see what's going on
* Match between system and real world - Names and data structures can easily be identified
* User control and freedom - Options
* Consistency and standards - [memes](https://xkcd.com/927/)
* Error prevention - A mistake does not 'penalise' the user
* Recognition rather than recall - Users should be able to navigate their way around the system, rather than remember a set of procedures
* Flexibility and efficiency of use - Options x2
* Aesthetic and minimalist design - Keep it simple!
* Help users recognise, diagnose, recover from errors - Useful info-tips and tool-tips
* Help and documentation
