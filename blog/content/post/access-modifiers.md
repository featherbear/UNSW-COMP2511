In the nature of Object Oriented Programming, attributes and methods can be assigned different access levels, exposing themselves to other classes.

This helps to mitigate accidental error of modifying an internal value.

# Access Levels

## `public` access

Everything has access

## `protected` access

Any subclass within any package has access

## default access (no modifier)

Any subclass only within the same package has access

## `private` access

No access
